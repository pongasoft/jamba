/**
 * The purpose of this class is to implement a view listener that is "self-contained":
 *
 * - this class MUST live at least as long as it is registered with the view
 * - this class offers an easy way to unregister early (if the client code desires to do so) while making sure that
 *   the instance is still valid.
 *
 * The typical code usage would be
 *
 * ```
 * // Create your own listener
 * class MyViewListener : public SelfContainedViewListener
 * {
 *   public:
 *     // override whichever method from IViewListener that you are interested in
 *     // if you override viewWillDelete, make sure to call SelfContainedViewListener::viewWillDelete
 * }
 *
 * // Scenario 1: you only care about creating a listener for the duration of the view
 * // we assume that it is being called from a custom controller
 * // (but can be called directly from a view using "this")
 * CView *verifyView(CView *iView, ...)
 * {
 *   if(iView ....)
 *   {
 *     // create and "forget"... completely self contained, no need to keep a reference to it
 *     SelfContainedViewListener::create<MyViewListener>(iView);
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * // Scenario 2: you want to be able to unregister at a later time
 * std::shared_ptr<MyViewListener> fListener{};
 *
 * CView *verifyView(CView *iView, ...)
 * {
 *   if(iView ....)
 *   {
 *     // keep a reference to it which is guaranteed to remain valid
 *     fListener = SelfContainedViewListener::create<MyViewListener>(iView);
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * void someCustomCode()
 * {
 *  if(fListener)
 *    fListener->unregister();
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Implementation note: internally this class keeps a `std::shared_ptr` to itself for as long as `this` is registered
 * with the view itself, ensuring that this class is not going to be deleted until the view goes away (or it is
 * unregistered). If an outside piece of code also has a reference to this class which is scenario 2, then the class
 * itself won't be deleted until this other reference goes away.
 *
 * @note Although this class is not marked internal and you can use it in your own code, it is used by the framework
 *       and you should rarely need to to use it.
