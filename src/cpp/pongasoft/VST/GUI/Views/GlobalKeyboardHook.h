/**
 * The `CView` class provides 2 methods to handle keyboard events (`CView::onKeyDown` and `CView::onKeyUp`) which
 * only works as long as the view itself has focus. This helper class is designed to set a keyboard hook which is
 * global so it will work whether the view has the focus or not. This class automatically handles registering
 * the hook to the frame (when it becomes available) and unregistering it automatically as well. As an added bonus
 * it is possible to dynamically change the callbacks after registration.
 *
 * Typical usage would be to use `Views::registerGlobalKeyboardHook()` this way:
 *
 * ```
 * // assuming we are writing a custom view
 * void initState(GUIState *iGUIState)
 * {
 *   // TODO: fix example
 *   CustomView::initState(iGUIState);
 *   Views::registerGlobalKeyboardHook(this)
 *     ->onKeyDown([this](VstKeyCode const &iKeyCode) -> auto {
 *       if(iKeyCode.character == 'z')
 *       {
 *         // do something...
 *         return CKeyboardEventResult::kKeyboardEventHandled;
 *       }
 *       return CKeyboardEventResult::kKeyboardEventNotHandled;
 *     })
 *     ->onKeyUp([this](VstKeyCode const &iKeyCode) -> auto {
 *       if(iKeyCode.character == 'z')
 *       {
 *         // do something else...
 *         return CKeyboardEventResult::kKeyboardEventHandled;
 *       }
 *       return CKeyboardEventResult::kKeyboardEventNotHandled;
 *    });
 * }
 * ```
